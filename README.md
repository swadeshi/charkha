The read/write client for a distributed peer-to-peer network of (social) data

## Status

This project is just an idea right now. If you think we should build it, speak up or get involved. We're listening.

## Get Involved

### Contribute Code

We're not writing any code yet, but you can contribute to the [dat jawn](http://datjawn.com) project. We will be using jawn to store feeds and replicate them across peers. The jawn project is based on a mentorship model (described in the blog post [Bypassing (some) Cultural, Gender and Racial Barriers by Training Great Engineers](https://flyingzumwalt.com/2016/02/03/bypassing-some-cultural-gender-and-racial-barriers-by-training-great-engineers/)), so we're always looking for people to be mentors, to pair program, or to help keep the code base moving forward.

### Contribute Ideas

Ideas? Questions? Concerns? Recommendations? Post them as issues in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/swadeshi/charkha/issues)


### Slack/irc

We'll probably create a Slack team at some point, but until then you can join the dat jawn team's slack channel, which is part of the Code for Philly slack channel. Follow the instructions under "Get Involved" on the [dat jawn project page](http://datjawn.com). Say hello!
